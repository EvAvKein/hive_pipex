# PIPEX

My 7th project at 42 Network's Hive Helsinki 🐝

Replicating shell's piping and redirection using child processes

> [!TIP]
> If you're at a 42 school and doing this project: It's genuinely so much better to ask fellow students instead of reading online solutions ✨

## Description

This project's about replicating the basic behavior of the following shell script:  
`< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile`

The bonus is about:
- Handling more than two commands (e.g. `< infile cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 > outfile`)
- Replicating the basic behavior following shell script:  
`cm1 << limiter | cmd2 >> appendfile`

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Code was written and tested for Linux (using Hive's Ubuntu iMacs)

<!-- - Optionally, adjust settings at `include/settings.h`
- Compile by running `make` (or `make visualize` for visualized map validation and game-state history)
- Run `./so_long` with a map (e.g. the ones in the `maps` directory) -->
